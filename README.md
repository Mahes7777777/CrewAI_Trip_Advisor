# AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Planner Using CrewAI

## ✨ Introduction
Planning a trip can be time-consuming and complex, involving research, budget management, and itinerary organization. To simplify this process, I developed an **AI-powered Travel Itinerary Planner** using **CrewAI**. This web app leverages multiple AI agents to automate travel planning, making it seamless and efficient.

## 🚀 Features
- **Travel Research Agent** 🏛️ - Fetches historical sites, transport, weather, and accommodation options.
- **Budget Planner Agent** 💰 - Finds budget-friendly flights, hotels, and activities.
- **Itinerary Planner Agent** 📅 - Creates a well-structured 3-day travel plan considering budget and weather constraints.
- **Real-time Search API Integration** 🔍 - Uses AI to fetch the latest travel details.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **CrewAI** - Framework for building AI-powered autonomous agents.
- **Google Gemini AI** - Provides intelligent responses for travel recommendations.
- **SerperDevTool** - Enables real-time web search for up-to-date information.
- **Python** - Used for implementing and integrating AI agents.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Input Destination & Budget** 💬
2. **AI Agents Research & Plan** 🤖
3. **Receive a Detailed Itinerary** 📜
4. **Refine & Customize as Needed** 🎯
